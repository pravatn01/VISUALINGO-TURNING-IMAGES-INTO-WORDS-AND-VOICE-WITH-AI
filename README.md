# VISUALINGO 🖼️➡️📝🔊  
**Turn images into captions—and voice—with AI.**

VISUALINGO is an AI-powered image captioning system that lets users generate image descriptions and hear them spoken aloud. It compares the performance of two distinct models:

- **CNN (DenseNet201) for feature extraction + LSTM decoder**, trained on the **Flickr8k** dataset using **TensorFlow**
- **Pretrained BLIP Transformer**, from Hugging Face (requires **PyTorch** runtime)

The app includes a user-friendly **Gradio UI**, where users can upload images, view captions generated by both models, and listen to them via **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)**.

## 🧠 Model Overview

| Model        | Architecture                        | Dataset   | Framework      |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Baseline     | DenseNet201 (features) + LSTM       | Flickr8k  | TensorFlow     |
| Transformer  | BLIP (Hugging Face, pretrained)     | N/A       | PyTorch Runtime|
